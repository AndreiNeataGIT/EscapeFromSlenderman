# EscapeFromSlenderman
This is a game I made in my first year of college.



## Overview

**Escape From Slenderman** is a 3D survival horror game developed in Unity as part of a school project in Computer Science. The game places the player in a dark forest environment where the objective is to collect all required pages while avoiding Slenderman. Once all pages are collected, a final sequence is triggered, leading to the player's escape from the nightmare.

This project was developed to demonstrate skills in game development, object-oriented programming, gameplay logic design, and interactive environment creation.

## Gameplay Description

The player wakes up in a mysterious forest surrounded by trees and darkness. The main objective is to:

1. Explore the environment.
2. Locate and collect hidden pages.
3. Avoid Slenderman, who stalks the player throughout the map.
4. Trigger the final event after collecting all pages.
5. Escape safely from the forest.

The atmosphere is designed to create tension using environmental audio, limited visibility, and enemy presence.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I developed and strengthened skills in:

* Object-Oriented Programming in C#
* Unity scene management
* Game logic design
* Player interaction systems
* Debugging and problem solving
* Asset integration and audio triggers
* Creating immersive environments

This project helped me better understand how gameplay mechanics, code structure, and user experience connect in a complete game system.

## Future Improvements

If further developed, the game could include:

* Advanced AI behavior (teleportation, dynamic stalking)
* Procedural map generation
* Inventory system
* Improved UI/UX
* Save/load functionality
* Multiple difficulty modes
